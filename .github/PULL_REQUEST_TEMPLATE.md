When submitting a pull request, please include the following information:

* **Emacs versions tested with:** 
* **Org versions tested with:** 
* **`helm` versions tested with:** 
* **`helm-core` versions tested with:** 

Note that Emacs and Org versions persist "in the wild" for some time after release, so it is **not** appropriate to only test with the latest released or development versions of Org; tests must include versions still commonly in use.  Proposed changes **must not** break functionality for existing users.
